# RESTful API - Consuming and Processing Data with Python

## Description
This project demonstrates how to consume and process data from a public API
using Python. It uses the `requests` library to fetch data from the
JSONPlaceholder API, parses JSON responses, prints data, and saves structured
data into a CSV file.

## Learning Objectives
- Use the `requests` library to send HTTP GET requests
- Parse JSON data using Python
- Process and structure API data
- Write structured data into a CSV file

## Files
- `task_02_requests.py`: Contains functions to fetch, print, and save posts
- `main_02_requests.py`: Entry point to execute the functions
- `posts.csv`: Generated CSV file containing posts data

## Usage
Install the requests library if not installed:
```bash
pip install requests
