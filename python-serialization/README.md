# 🐍 Python Serialization - Basic Serialization

## 📖 Project Overview

Welcome to **Basic Serialization**! This project introduces you to the fundamental concept of **serialization** in Python. Serialization allows you to **convert Python objects into a format that can be saved to a file** or transmitted over a network, and then **reconstruct them later**.

In this project, we focus on **Python dictionaries** and how to **serialize them to JSON** and **deserialize them back** into Python objects.

## ⚡ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- 🔹 Understand the difference between **serialization** and **marshaling**.
- 🔹 Convert Python dictionaries into **JSON format**.
- 🔹 Save serialized data to a **file**.
- 🔹 Load JSON data from a file and **reconstruct the original Python dictionary**.
- 🔹 Apply basic **file handling best practices** in Python.

## 📝 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external modules except Python standard library (`json` is allowed).
- All files must be executable (`chmod +x`).
